## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my PyTorch journey,
providing a quick reference or review for specific subjects as needed.

## Acknowledgments
I'd like to extend special thanks to [Daniel Bourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke) for his lectures,
resources, and knowledge shared freely on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mrdbourke).
